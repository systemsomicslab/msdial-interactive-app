# Changelog

Notable changes to MS-DIAL Interactive. The package version is kept in
`pyproject.toml` and `msdial_app/__init__.py`; the Agent API version is separate.
Agent API 0.5 requires the repository split endpoint introduced after API 0.4.

## [0.5.0] - Unreleased

Agent API 0.5 rejects a 0.4 backend as incompatible.

### Added
- Repository split preview and confirmed split of a Mixed unit by acquisition mode.
  Parts retain their own files and Class assignments, share raw data without copying
  it, and start with `execution_allowed=false`. (#27)
- Interrupted repository downloads resume from `.part` using HTTP Range; library
  storage can be set with `library_directory` or `MSDIAL_LIBRARY_DIRECTORY`. (#24)
- Run manifests record zero-threshold peak diagnostics, retention policy, failed
  runs, and the CLI `--raw-retention-policy` choice. (#23)
- Agent status reports `app_version`, Agent API 0.5, and capabilities for unit
  splitting, confirmed raw cleanup, download resume, required mzXML conversion,
  and automatic alignment RT correction. The MCP server reports its package version.
- Optional LC-MS automatic alignment-only RT correction: selects anchors from
  detected peaks and applies corrected times for alignment while leaving peak
  picking and annotation on original RTs. The 15 method keys and defaults are:
  `execute automatic rt correction for alignment` (false),
  `automatic rt correction reference file id` (-1, automatic),
  `automatic rt correction rt bin width` (0.5 min),
  `automatic rt correction match rt tolerance` (0.5 min),
  `automatic rt correction minimum anchors` (3),
  `automatic rt correction maximum anchors` (6),
  `automatic rt correction minimum sample coverage` (0.5),
  `automatic rt correction intensity quantile` (0.75),
  `automatic rt correction maximum peak width quantile` (0.5),
  `automatic rt correction minimum signal to noise` (3),
  `automatic rt correction minimum gaussian similarity` (0),
  `automatic rt correction minimum ideal slope` (0),
  `automatic rt correction outlier mad threshold` (3.5),
  `automatic rt correction reference centrality weight` (0.35), and
  `automatic rt correction interpolate blanks by analytical order` (true).
  Validation requires LC-MS, alignment enabled, no simultaneous user-defined RT
  correction, at least two minimum anchors, a maximum not below the minimum,
  positive RT bin width/match tolerance/MAD threshold, and quantiles, coverage,
  and centrality weight within [0,1]. The UI and agent expose these settings;
  Methods and Table S1 describe correction only when the Console summary and
  anchor audit TSVs plus `method.keys.json` prove it ran. This requires a Console
  built from the feature branch; it is not yet on MsdialWorkbench master.

### Changed
- Raw-header preflight checks all inputs by default; capped inspection is marked
  partial and remains under review. Mixed acquisition modes or contradictory
  headers block execution; DIA with missing file types also blocks. (#26)
- Split parts are judged from their own files and record retained Class coverage.
  (#28, #30)
- A repository unit matches analysis inputs by its sample file names; stem matching
  is allowed only when the listed name has no extension. mzML is accepted. (#25)
- `.mzXML`, `.mzData`, and `.mzData.xml` are `requires_conversion`: they are excluded
  before download with msconvert guidance. File picker, CSV import, and path
  expansion reject them. This corrects the earlier mzXML acceptance in #25.
- MCP restart now reports that it does not reload changed Python source and tells
  callers to reconnect the MCP process. (#29)
- Unknown raw-retention policies resolve to keep and produce a warning. (#23)

### Fixed
- Integer parameters are written as integers, so the Console can parse them. (#23)
- Agent-driven runs retain mzTab-M validation, artifact inventory, and the raw
  retention verdict. (#23)
- Truncated downloads fail while preserving their `.part`; archive-only units do
  not lose their input allow-list. (#24, #25)
- Conversion-required entries do not appear as eligible analysis inputs, and the
  real-shape ST003038 fixture checks that a split never uses their sample names.

### Known limitations
- Runs from 2026-09-03 until this release recorded package version 0.4.7 across
  different code states; the Interactive commit was not recorded.
- Metabolomics Workbench study archives can fail checksum validation after a full
  download. Units with parallel mzML and mzXML archives but `.mzXML` sample names
  remain excluded even when an mzML encoding exists.
- Console source builds need an explicit provenance check; the MCP backend is still
  embedded in its process and must be reconnected to load new code.
- Run-start provenance, instrument family from headers, analytical-order timestamps,
  split-parent raw cleanup, and complete method-key accounting remain future work.

## [0.4.7] - 2026-09-07

This version label appeared across more than one code state before #22 merged.

### Added
- Repository reanalysis automation, tiered LC-MS annotation, Console source-build
  inspection, and release-channel selection. (#11, #19, #21)
- Confirmed raw cleanup after preview; the server no longer deletes raw data
  automatically after a run. (#12)
- Positive/negative lipidome merge, Class proposals, opt-in input staging, and
  saved run worksets. (#21)

### Changed
- Approved Catalog Class assignments apply directly. (#15)
- MCP errors expose backend detail, HTTP status, and endpoint. (#17)
- Download limits use decimal GB and are checked against the handoff. (#18)
- Console provenance distinguishes verified, absent, stale, and unreadable;
  unsupported raw formats are separate from an unavailable preflight. (#19, #20)
- Run manifests retain Console and library checksums and a suggested per-file
  minimum peak height; Class grouping needs confirmation. (#21)

### Fixed
- `execution_allowed` is enforced at every Console start, and diagnostics do not
  write into production outputs. (#16)
- Production runs check expected exports; uncomputed annotation scores accept
  both Console notations. (#17, #11)
- GC-MS method keys use Console names for RI alignment tolerance and MSP cutoffs.
  (#9, merged with #22)
